# eoWork

Hi there! This is a repository containing my work for eo LLC, a student-run bikeshare start-up in the Garage at Northwestern, as the Head of Data Analytics and Software. The WebScrapingTest folder contains my code for extracting all the GPS data points for an individual bike and storing it as a CSV which I could then export into ArcGIS to be mapped and visualized.

In the locations180.jpg file, you can see an example of what the location heatmaps would look like. More concentrated areas are more commonly visited locations.
